My story; Living with the scars
As narrated to Fardosa Hussein 
fardee86@gmail.com 

Twelve years letter I am still learning how to live with the scars of the cut.

Still fresh in my memory is that fateful day in December when it all happened. 

My two cousins and I had just turned 10 years. Our parents booked us bus tickets to Mandera barely two days after schools had closed. They said such holidays were meant to reconnect us to our roots. But they lied. Or didn’t they?

The trip excited us, just like it would any other child our age. It was our virgin visit to Mandera. Little did we know what was in store for us down there.

A few days prior to our departure a cousin of ours had narrated to us her ordeal in the hands of the cutters. It did not hit us that was soon to be our fate. Afterall, our parents had asked us to have fun while upcountry - never even for once did they mention about the cut.

She was the last of the 10 girls who underwent female genital mutilation (FGM) at my grandmother’s homestead to heal from the cut. She developed an infection around her genitalia which made it hard for her to pass urine. Each time she complained about the discomfort, more and more grounded herb called ‘malmal’ (Myrrh) was used on her until she healed from the physical pain… mental pain sticks with you forever. Malmal is a tree sap and it’s poured on wounds when it’s super hot but dries fast.

FGM is a procedure involving partial or total removal of the female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs, or any harmful procedure to the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. The act is illegal in Kenya and many other parts of the world.

Growing into adulthood, I came to learn that with the existence of the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2011 parents and medical practitioners feared being arrested for keeping the practice rife in Nairobi - and that is why we had to take the long trip down to Mandera in guise of a holiday trip. Clearly our parents lied with no good intentions. 

After two and a half days on the roads, we got to Mandera with a grand welcome. My grandmother even slaughtered a goat for us and in the evening she took us to town where she bought each of us three ‘deeras’ (kaftans). We also received a lot of goodies from our relatives.

One evening my grandmother came back from the market and summoned the three of us from the city. That is when the bombshell was dropped - we were going to undergo the cut.

Everything had been scheduled for the next day and the cutter was to find us in a clean ‘hori’ (manyatta) next to the cowshed, which we had to cleaned before darkness fell, she said.

Wait. Did I mention how we wailed after the news? We threw ourselves on the ground and wailed like never before.

That feeling of betrayal by our own parents cannot be explained in words.

Was this the ‘reconnection with our roots’ that we had come all the way from Nairobi for?

We thought of running away that night but where to? Mandera was new to us. Moreover, we were only 10-years.

We felt helpless. Cheated. Betrayed. 

That night was the shortest. I dreaded daybreak.

My grandmother forced us out of bed and demanded that we hurry and clean the hori. 

Then at exactly 7am a woman in her mid seventies walked into our compound with a ragged, dirty bag. 

She walked towards us and said ‘I hope you are prepared because I am’ *sic*. 

I couldn’t stand her, let alone sit at her mercy and watch her mutilate my womanhood. I tried hiding within the compound but my cousins told on me. Each one of us took a shower and went into the hori. There were other women in the hori who were there just in case we resisted.

The cutter pointed at me first because I was the tiniest of the three of us. I pleaded with my grandmother but she pulled me towards the old lady who made me lie on the bare ground. She then pointed at two women who were in the hori to come hold my legs apart until she was done. 

I laid there stiff with my head held to the ground. I was helpless.

The cutter then moved in closer, took her tools out of the dirty ragged bag - A razor blade and ‘malmal’ (ground myrrh). 

In our time, the style of cutting performed on girls was called firĉaaun where the whole clitoris is removed. It was pain beyond imagination as the cutter did not use any anaesthesia. Immediately the cutter was done removing my clitoris she poured the pounded malmal on my wound. She requested to be given strips torn from an old deera to tie my legs together. 

She would warn me of dangers of untying myself before I healed as they carried me to a corner of the hori.  It is believed that if you start walking or playing before the wound heals the cutter will be called again to sew you up. That’s another level of pain no girl who has gone through the cut would want to experience - again.
 
It was now my cousins turn. The drama that unfolded was on another level. 

She put up a fight against the dedicated women assigned to hold her legs apart. Being big-bodied seemed to work to her advantage. But not for long.

At one point she managed to free one of her legs and used the opportunity to kick the cutter who was now sitting on a crooked stool. 

The hot slap she received from my grandmother was threat enough - she had to comply. My grandma made no bone of that fact.

The women were called back and this last time she had to be calm or risk being cut wrongly and having to suffer unwanted injuries. The cutter closed business by 9 am. 

The cut was performed in the early hours of the morning before the sun scorches to allow the girls feel “less pain” while undergoing the cut. 

With the help of the two women my grandmother managed to put the three of us on mat outside the hut so that we could bask in the sun.  

She then invited the cutter and the rest of the women for a cup of tea before they left. 

The next three weeks were full of agony. 

We dragged ourselves on the ground so as to move from one place to another. Sometimes our grandmother would tell us stories and we would laugh while other days were adorned with silence and mood swings. The mental trauma was a burden too heavy to bare and our mothers were not  around to comfort us. 

My grandmother reminded us every day that we were no longer little girls and that we should start acting like women. But how were we to act like women? We were only 10 years old.

I was the first to heal after three weeks of gruesome pain. Then we had to be taught how to walk again. My grandmother gave me clear instruction on how to walk to avoid injuring myself. Both my cousin healed two weeks later. Luckily no one developed any form of complication. 

Schools were about to open and we had to get going. This time round our parents booked us flight tickets because of our condition. 

My grandmother made it clear that we were not supposed to talk about what had happened over the holiday with our friends at school.
We flew back to Nairobi safely and continued with our lives like nothing happened. 

I wonder who talks about their cut experience. I used to feel embarrassed in campus when my fellow classmates joked about girls who are circumcised. Not only did I suffer physically but I am also forced to live with the emotional scars from that horrid experience. It was not my wish to go through the cut and for that my future daughter will be lucky because I will not let societal pressure make her go through what I was forced to.
