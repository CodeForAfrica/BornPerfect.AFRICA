BREAKING THE CURSE
By Diana Kendi 

Sixty year old Longoima Lesiale has three wives and 21 children. Five out of his seven daughters have undergone the cut. 
The remaining daughters have not been cut. This is mainly due to pressure from his youngest wife who finally succeeded in convincing him that the cut is retrogressive and causes harm to the girl.

Longoima is now convinced that female genital mutilation (FGM) is a cultural practice that the Maa community should give up.  He says the practise is largely to blame for the high illiteracy among women and girls in the community and contributes to high incidence of child marriages. 

“Our daughters are also marrying into other communities because they are afraid of being cut or being cast out if they are not cut. We have to adopt new thinking and reject any practise that is taking us backwards,” says Longoima.

According to the Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS 2014),  the more educated a woman is, the less likely she is to be circumcised or have her daughters circumcised. 

The KDHS data also shows education levels of women in counties where the Maa communities dominate are dismally low. 

For decades now, Maasai women and girls specifically the uncut, have been living in fear. This is because of the curse that was imposed by the elders in that community to girls who give birth before being circumcised, commonly referred to as ‘Entaapai’.  

The elders considered them as disrespectful to their culture. They believed that a girl who becomes pregnant before being cut is an abomination to the entire community, and once she has given birth, she is regarded to as an outcast and her child thrown away.

Not only were the uncircumcised girls affected, but also the boys who impregnated them. They would be subjected to paying hefty fines comprising of cows and blankets, as well as being forgotten in the community. 

Longoima, an elder at Chumvi area in Laikipia North, says that FGM has kept their women and girls on check by ensuring that they do not engage in promiscuous sex. It also protects the girls and their families from the shame and taboo that would follow if a girl becomes pregnant before circumcision.

Different communities have told different narratives about FGM in Kenya.

FGM is, however, not just a Kenyan affair. It is practiced in at least 26 of 43 African countries; the prevalence varies from 98 per cent in Somalia to five per cent in Zaire.

A review of country-specific Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) shows FGM prevalence rates of 97 per cent in Egypt, 94.5 per cent in Eritrea, 93.7 per cent in Mali, 89.2 per cent in Sudan, and 43.4 per cent in the Central African Republic.

FGM is also found among some ethnic groups in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, as well as in parts of India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The practice has also become more common in Europe, Australia and North America due to immigration by people from countries where FGM is common.

FGM - a painful and damaging ritual - was outlawed in the country in 2001 but a majority of girls from semi-nomadic tribes including Maasai and Samburu are still subjected to it.

Official data shows that FGM prevalence currently stands at 21 per cent nationwide but the prevalence is  78 per cent in the Maasai community. 


The practise which is deeply rooted in Maa culture involves removing and damaging healthy, normal female genital tissue which eventually interferes with natural body functions.

According to KDHS, the more educated a woman the less like she would be circumcised. With a higher percentage of Maa women being illiterate, circumcision remains high. For example, only 24.7 per cent of women between the ages of 15-49 years from the Maa community in Laikipia County compared to the national average which is 


Only 17.9 per cent of women aged between 15-49 years in Kajiado County completed primary school while only 10.4 per cent of women completed secondary School in the same period.

In Narok County, the percentage rate went lower by more than half with only 7.3 per cent of women between 15-49 years completing primary school while 10.4 per cent completing secondary.

In Samburu County a similar percentage of 7.3 per cent of women as those in Narok completed primary school whereas only 5.4 per cent of them completed secondary school in the same period.



Condemning the Curse
In November last year, more than 20 elders from counties dominated by the Maa community met with representatives of the Anti-FGM Board, Mukogodo Girls Empowerment Program, Laikipia among other stakeholders to discuss strategies on how to stop the cut.
The event was to break the curse that the community believes befalls any young woman who becomes pregnant before the cut. The elders conducted rituals to release the young and men responsible from the ‘curse’.

The morans— young men aged between 19-30 years who attended the event  said they were opposed to FGM. Several of them who spoke said they may consider marrying outside of the community if the practise continued. They said they no longer want to marry circumcised girls. 

A young Maasai girl talked of the shame she felt whenever she tried to interact with girls from other communities who do not practice the cut. 
“I refuse to be cut. I want my rights and those of other girls like me protected,” the 11-year-old girl told the audience.
