Traditional birth attendants (TBA) in the Somali community play a major role in perpetuating the cut. Despite the introduction of free maternity in 2013, many Somali women still seek out the services of traditional birth attendants. 
Sumeya* is a well known health professional who moonlights as a cutter. She offered to take me to Mama Khadija* a traditional birth attendant who works from her home in Eastleigh, Section 3 and is also known for her skills in re-infibulating— re-stitching women who have undergone FGM.
Interviewing Sumeya had proved difficult as her services are in great demand. The only option was either to camp at her home or tag along as she moved from house to house providing her services—safe from the watchful eyes of the law. Sumeya provides her services when she is off duty from the health facility where she works.

Sumeya’s first stop was at the home of a woman who wanted to be re-infibulated, a week after giving birth at the Aga Khan Hospital, one of the most prestigious private hospital in Kenya. I asked Sumeya why many Somali women insisted on being re-infibulated. “Hmm...some of them don’t have an option because their husbands want them ‘tight’ again after giving birth. I stitch them up every other time they give birth”, Sumeya says as we crossed the road to the woman’s house. I waited for her in a corridor leading to the bedroom. Sumeya did not stay for long. We were out in 30 minutes. 

For the operation, Sumeya made Sh5,000. That is not her usual rate as she says this depends on what the client can afford. “This particular client offered me Sh5,000. I don’t do an operation for less than a Sh1,000”, she says.

From the bustling Eastleigh streets filled with hawkers and shoppers, we walked for 15 minutes to Eastleigh Section three where we were to meet with Mama Khadija, the traditional birth attendant who lives in an apartment of a five-story building. Sumeya advised me to record the conversation with my phone.
We had to use our phone torches to navigate the stairways which was extremely dark even though it was during the day.  I couldn’t imagine how a pregnant woman in the throes of labour could make her way to the old woman’s house. After a knock on the door, Mama Khadiha said in Somali “Make your way in. The door is never locked in case of emergencies!”

The 85-year old Mama Khadija* has been a traditional birth attendant for a decades. “My mother used to help women deliver and when she died I took over”, she says as she makes spaces for us to sit on her bed.  Sumeya and Khadija are ‘business partners'. She wants to know whether l am one of Sumeya’s client. Sumeya laughs saying “She is my student. I am training her to help the next generation of women”. Khadija nods in agreement and looks at me “Young girl you are doing the right thing”. 

Mama Khadija said she has helped many women through their pregnancy (foetal massage to position the baby in the womb and to avoid breech births) as well as delivery. On a busy night she says she attends to six mothers to attend but on average, she has one or two women coming in for her services.

As we are talking, there is a knock at the door and a very pregnant woman walks in. I stand up and vacate the bed where l was sitting so that the pregnant woman can sit. Mama Khadija quickly changes the topic and asks the woman whether she is feeling any pains. The lady nods and says “I came for a massage only”. 

Mama Khadija introduces the woman to Sumeya and extols her services as a ‘cutter’. “She circumcises girls very well. You should invite her to your place when your two girls are ready for the cut”. 
Sumeya and the pregnant woman exchange numbers. The woman says she has been looking for someone to circumcise her daughters. Her only concern is how long it would take the girls to heal after the cut. She is enthusiastic when she is told the girls will be all healed a week after the cut.

Mama Khadija said she had never lost a client. “I thank Allah because not even one of my clients has died while giving birth. Some suffer complications and I immediately advise that they be taken to the nearby hospitals. But even with modern hospitals, women still pay me a visit because they want to be re stitched after giving birth”, says Khadija. 
It is for this service which Mama Khadija is known for but she is not overly concerned. She knows the risk she takes every time she re-stitches a woman since this is against the law. 
She and Sumeya are however in agreement as to why women will continue to demand their services.  “A big part of the problem is that our women don’t have the liberty to decide what to do with their bodies because of the demands their partners or husbands make. That is why we live with the consequences of FGM forever,” Mama Khadija says.
