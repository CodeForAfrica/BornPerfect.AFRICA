Noor Abdulkadir was only 10 years old when his seven-year-old sister was circumcised. 

Twenty one years later he is still filled with guilt for not having done something to protect her from the cut. 

Unlike most young boys his age who were more concerned about going to school, fetching water or engaging in other childhood activities, Abdulkadir was traumatised by what had happened and always worried about what he could do to stop Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).

“I remember watching my sister tremble hopelessly as the door behind her was shut. I could feel her fear but the most excruciating pain for me was I helpless. I could not help her. I let her down,” recalls Abdulkadir.
He is now the Program Coordinator of Breaking the Silence project which aims to encourage a change in attitudes towards FGM in communities where the practise is common. The project is a programme by the Horn of Africa Development Initiative,  a non-governmental organisation championing for justice and development in the Northern parts of Kenya.

Abdulkadir is slowly changing the FGM narrative in the Borana community where it was and still is taboo for men to speak up against the practice.

“I made a vow to myself that my daughters would not be circumcised,” the 31 year old Abdikadir says. “I know that women who have undergone the cut have to bear a lot of pain. That is enough inspiration for me to break the silence and have a conversation on FGM with members of my community.”

All the women in his life including his mother and two sisters have undergone the cut.

For his advocacy, Abdikadir has seen his circle of friends dwindle as most of his agemates while free to talk about all aspects of life, draw the line at talking about FGM.  He is now considered a lone wolf among his peers.

“Most young men have a negative attitude towards this subject. They are also skeptical about my intentions. They seem to doubt my commitment to advocating about this issue,” he says.

He has found that women and girls in the community are much more forthcoming and are willing to have these conversations as they want to be informed about the subject.

Acceptance within the community

Since he started his advocacy in 2013, he says members of his community have exhibited their support by attending workshops organised by HODI  which is a positive sign towards the change of attitude towards a cultural practise that is so deep-rooted. 

He said that while the men, particularly the elderly, are receptive to all topics, they are so open to discuss issues to do with FGM.

“Some of them say the cut is part of the culture and no amount of convincing will make them change their minds.  Convincing women to have these kind of talks amongst themselves is a step in the right direction,” he said.

Elderly men among the Borana community are considered the decision makers and Breaking the Silence has to overcome the hurdle of getting them to at least have these conversations. 

The journey has not been easy, but with hope, Abdulkadir sees a near future where religious leaders (both imams and pastors) will also take up the campaign to break the silence on FGM. 

“ We are doing this to slowly. Changing the attitudes of the people cannot be done through force. We cannot force them to stop the cut all at once,” he said.
