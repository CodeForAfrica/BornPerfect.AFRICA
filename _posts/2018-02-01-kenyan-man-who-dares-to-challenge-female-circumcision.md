Kenyan man who dares to challenge female circumcision

Gesaka Chacha stands out in a group of community members assembled at a chief’s camp to discuss issues about female genital mutilation (FGM).

He is the only elderly man in the group comprising mainly women and young men in Maeta village in Kuria East, Migori County. 

When he stands to address the villagers who are listening to radio programmes on female genital mutilation, he receives a notably attentive audience. The 74-year-old is articulate and unashamedly talks about a topic deemed taboo in this region. 

“Our community is highly cultured and it takes a strong-willed person to change tune on some of our practices such as FGM. I have offered to be that person,” says Chacha. 

Since March 2017, community members in Maeta village have engaged in community radio talk shows produced by the Association of Media Women in Kenya with support from the Girl Generation. 
The programmes seek to sensitize community members on FGM matters while allowing them to discuss the issues openly. 

Mr Chacha is the only elderly man in the group. This is after defying calls by his fellow elders to stay firm on the cultural stand on the female cut. 

Born in 1943, Mzee Chacha, as popularly known in the village, worked in Nairobi until his retirement; an experience he says exposed him to the benefits of educating the girl-child. He is now a farmer and an ardent campaigner against FGM and early marriages.
Although he has educated all his daughters, Chacha often found himself on the wrong side with his fellow elders. 

“They thought I am bewitched. The elders wondered how an elderly man like me would talk ill of our traditional practices,” he recalls with  a pensive look.

Having lived in Kisumu, Mombasa and Nairobi, Chacha says, he met women who had escaped female circumcision as girls and were now leaders in various offices. This, he says, inspired him to push his own daughters to aim high. 

He knew his first assignment was to ensure that his two younger daughters escaped the knife because he was now more informed on women’s rights. 

“Mimi na boma yangu tumeamua kuuasi ukeketaji (My family has decided to say no to female circumcision),” he says.
 
The father of six is now a champion for girls’ rights, particularly calling on the community members to end FGM.

“I have also been calling on the men to have their sons circumcised at a health facility for their own health benefits. But they believe that unless one has been cut by a traditional circumciser through the Kuria traditional practices, the cut is not any meaningful,” he says. 

The Kuria community valued circumcision as a crucial process to usher girls into womanhood. According to Chacha, FGM preparations begin in August where young men and women train in songs and dances ahead of the circumcision sessions in December. 

Many children lose out on school hours while others drop out in the four months of preparations, he says. This is the same time that Standard Eight and Form Four students are preparing for their Kenya Certificate of Primary Education and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education national examinations. 

“The practice negatively affects the preparedness of the candidates, some of whom have to devote their time to the circumcision ceremony rehearsals hence poor performance in their examinations,” he explains.
 
Chacha says his age mates are the problem. 
When he first brought the anti-FGM campaign to them in early 2016, Chacha the 75 year-old became a lone ranger. 

The older men and women did not identify with him. They said he had been bewitched. 

“But I did not fear. I soldiered on because I believe it starts with one person then the next and before long, the outlawed practices such as FGM will be eradicated,” he affirms.
  
Chacha knows too well that to eradicate any outlawed cultural practice, the cultural elders, particularly the men, are key. 
“Unajua wazee hapa ndio wanaleta shida (the men are the problem here),” he says while calling upon the area chief to lead the war against FGM.

In one circumcision season, according to Chacha, more than 100 young girls undergo FGM in the area. 

According to the United Nations Children's Fund over 200 million women globally have undergone FGM. 

In his campaign, Chacha visits homes, schools and elders’ gatherings in a quest to create awareness on the dangers of FGM. 

“For Maeta, Kedege and Kegongo primary schools I hold brief sessions with the pupils, with permission from the teachers,” he says.
Chacha strategically plans his training sessions from July ahead of the annual December circumcision sessions. 

He has been sitting with a group of three to eight cultural elders every day since 2016, discussing on ways to end FGM.

“Mine is usually to convince them on the dangers of FGM. I am optimistic that this is going to bear fruit,” he said.
